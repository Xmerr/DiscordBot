# Xmerbot

Xmerbot's purpose is to save images to be retrieved when needed.
Currently that's all he can do. In the future he will have much more capabilities.


### Save Files

Xmerbot's advanced AI allows him to understand what you're saying - to an extent.
To save a file simply tell him "Xmerbot, save \<url\> as \<filename\>" or any variation of that.

### Load Files

The same with saving, simply tell xmerbot what you want to load.
He constantly indexes his memory to ensure that he will understand any user you tell him to load.
For instance, "Xmerbot, load Xmer's cat image" will load my cat image (if you are using the same server as me).

### Querying

Xmerbot can query it's memory. You can ask him "Xmerbot, who has stored files in your system?" and he will
respond with a list of users. You can also say "Xmerbot, what files have I uploaded?" or even "Xmerbot, what files has Xmer uploaded?"

### Notes

* Xmerbot is still young and is constantly learning.
* Everything you say must begin with xmerbot to ensure you're talking to him.
* He does have small talk installed, but it's also in the early stages (and he's not really nice)
